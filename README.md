			jCalculus - Mathematical Calculus Package
==========================================================================

*Note: This library is no more maintained and it was created as part of my final year project.*

jCalculus, is Prolog + Java interface package. The calculus source is written in Prolog and it is interfaced using gnuprolog, with Java.

if you want to use it, feel free to use it and improve it. Just add some credit so that I would be happy to see that my work is useful enough for someone.
